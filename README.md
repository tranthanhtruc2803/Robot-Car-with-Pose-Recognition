# Robot-Car-with-Pose-Recognition
A robot car controlled by human pose.\
Data for human pose recognition are collected with the help of MediaPipe library.\
The recognition model then trained with LSTM-CNN model.\
The robot car prototype functions are tested using an Android App.\
The recognition finally performed by Jetson Nano and send the predictions to Arduino UNO via UART.
